If you prefer running the production server on Linux, you will soon be able to use a backup of this app as input for its Java and Tomcat based sister application BandikaJson (also on GitHub).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It features - template based content (three levels of templates), - custom tags for dynamic content - WYSIWYG editing, - draft and published content versions - right based read, write and publishing access - JSON based persistence, - backup and restore of all created data - an app based control interface including log viewer, style and template editing - and much more<\/p>\r\n\r\n<p>It lacks<\/p>\r\n\r\n<ul>\r\n\t<li>more ideas and requests for better satisfying your demands.<\/li>\r\n\t<li>more enthusiastic developers who would like to share this path.<\/li>\r\n<\/ul>\r\n\r\n<p>Just contact me!<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h1>App View<\/h1>\r\n\r\n<p>The frontend of the app has two panels: the server and the layout panel.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h2>Server Panel<\/h2>\r\n\r\n<p>On the server panel you can set the basic configuration and start and stop the HTTP server.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Configuration<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>Here you can set - the App name (for the web as well), - the web host name (which should be known to the system) and - the web port (which should not be occupied by another app).<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h3>Backups<\/h3>\r\n\r\n<p>You can also create and restore backups.
